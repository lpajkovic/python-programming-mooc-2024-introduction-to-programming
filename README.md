# Python Programming MOOC 2024 - Introduction to Programming

These are my exercise solutions for the Introduction to Programming part of [University of Helsinki's free massive open online course Python Programming 2024](https://programming-24.mooc.fi/grading-and-exams). 

Since the requirement for completion is to receive at least 25% of the exercise points for each of the seven parts on the course before taking the exam, some of the exercises haven't been solved (I'll do that when I find some time).
